Kruskal's algorithm is implemented by using a disjoint-set data structure, where each set represents a tree
in the forest, and the trees are gradually merged to form the MST. And, the set of edges are 
sorted initially in increasing order of weight and processed one by one

Prim's algorithm at any time always maintains a single tree "A", which will eventually grow to form the MST.
The tree starts from an arbitrary root vertex "r". In each iteration, it adds to tree "A" a minimum-weight edge that
connects the tree to the rest of the vertices. The process repeats until all vertices are added to the tree
